# hello-world
My first repository (I don't exactly know what I'm doing so I don't exactly know where you are going neither)

We're knights of the round table.
we dance whene'er we're able.
we do routines and chorus scenes
with footwork impeccable.
we dine well here in camelot.
we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.
we're knights of the round table.
our shows are formidable,
but many times we're given rhymes
that are quite unsingable.
we're opera mad in camelot.
we sing from the diaphragm a lot.
In war we're tough and able,
quite indefatigable.
between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate clark gable.
it's a busy life in camelot.
I have to push the pram a lot.

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.
